# ProjectManager
A program to help organize and manage future projects as well as progress towards completing them.

## Things to do
- handle possible conflict that may arise when two projects of the same name are attempted to be saved
  - either eliminate possibility two projects with the same name or establish a more coherent naming convention
- Create GUI to interact with the data model
  - should utilize a list of Projects to store all the relevant information
  - should allow you to create and delete entire projects
  - should have side pane to view all projects and main text field for viewing content of a single project
  - display Title of project at the top in large text
  - display summary under that in smaller text
  - display the Todo list under that
    - Todo list items should be interactive, allowing you to change their text and check off the box next to them
    - todo list tasks should be intended once when they are under another todo list
